# Oath
## Introduction
“Oath” is a 2D roguelike game that combines the survival gameplay of "Vampire Survivors" with the lore and character-driven storytelling of "League of Legends". In this game, the player will be guided to unlock abilities, acquire strong passive items, level up the abilities and the passive items, and pass through waves of enemies as well as several boss fights. "Oath" is developed using the Unity engine and has taken advantage of its powerful features, including its cross-platform capability.
