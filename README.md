# Oath

## Game Introduction
“Oath” is a 2D roguelike game that combines the survival gameplay of "Vampire Survivors" with the lore and character-driven storytelling of "League of Legends." In this game, the player will be guided to unlock abilities, acquire strong passive items, level up the abilities and the passive items, and pass through waves of enemies as well as several boss fights. "Oath" was developed using the Unity engine and has taken advantage of its powerful features, including its cross-platform capability.

## Game Features
### Infinte Map
Unlike most of the traditional RPG games, the map in Oath is infinite. The map can be viewed as a straight line extending indefinitely to the left and right. So no matter which direction (left or right) the player chooses to go, the map always extends to infinity. This infinite map ensures that the player has a high degree of freedom and also provides plenty of room to fight.

### Randomness
Randomness is a key feature of Oath. In each map slice, the constructions are different. And there is a probability of generating a treasure box in each map slice. When the player opens the treasure box, there is also a probability of getting a positive effect (e.g., recovering health) or a negative effect (e.g., taking damage). Therefore, as the player progresses, the map they encounter is always different, which greatly avoids aethetic fatigue and getting lost. When the player has gained enough experience from defeating enemies, it is given a chance to get a new passive item or upgrade one of its abilities or passive items. The player can choose from three choices, and the three choices are given at random.

### Various Combinations
Based on the randomness of the game, various combinations of passive items along with the abilities provide the player with a wealth of play strategies, further increasing the uncertainty as well as the entertainment of the game.
