# Oath

## Game Introduction
“Oath” is a 2D roguelike game that combines the survival gameplay of "Vampire Survivors" with the lore and character-driven storytelling of "League of Legends." In this game, the player will be guided to unlock abilities, acquire strong passive items, level up the abilities and the passive items, and pass through waves of enemies as well as several boss fights. "Oath" was developed using the Unity engine and has taken advantage of its powerful features, including its cross-platform capability.

## Game Features
### Infinte Map
Unlike most of the traditional RPG games, the map in Oath is infinite. The map can be viewed as a straight line extending indefinitely to the left and right. So no matter which direction (left or right) the player chooses to go, the map always extends to infinity. This infinite map ensures that the player has a high degree of freedom and also provides plenty of room to fight.
